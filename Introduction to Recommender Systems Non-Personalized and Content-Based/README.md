#### A bit of history
- Ants, caveman and early recommender systems
    - The emergence of critics
- Information retrieval and filtering 
- Manual collaborative filtering
- Automated collaborative filtering
- The commercial Era 

#### Information retrieval
- Static content base
    - Invest time in indexing content
- Dynamic information needed
    - Queries presented in real times
- Common approach: TFIDF
    - Rank documents by term overlap
    - Rank terms by frequency

#### Information filtering
- Reverse assumptions from IR
    - Static information needed 
    - Dynamic comment base
- Invest effort in modeling user need
    - Hand-created "profile"
    - Machine learned profile
    - Feedback/updates
- Pass new content through filters

#### Collaborative filtering 
- premise
    - Information needs more complex than keywords or topics: quality and taste
- Small community: Manual
    - Tapestry - database of content and comments
    - Active CF - easy mechanisms for forwarding

#### Recommenders as big data
- Heavy emphasis on analysis and evaluation
    -   Exploring data to determine best recommendation approaches
    -   Algorithms optimze performance against metrics
    -   Metrics designed to improve user experience and business goals
